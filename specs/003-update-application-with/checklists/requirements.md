# Specification Quality Checklist: Home Page Authentication & Admin Management

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 19, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

âœ… **All quality checks passed**

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality:**

- Specification is written in business terms without technical implementation details
- Focus is on user needs, authentication experience, and administrative capabilities
- Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness:**

- All 20 functional requirements are specific and testable
- No clarification markers present - all requirements are concrete
- Success criteria include specific metrics (2 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 95%, etc.)
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of frameworks, databases, etc.)
- Four user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios covering main flows
- Edge cases identify 8 potential scenarios requiring handling
- Scope is bounded to home page authentication and admin management only
- Assumptions section clearly documents dependencies

**Feature Readiness:**

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories cover authentication flow, approval process, and admin management
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No technical implementation details present in specification

## Notes

Specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan` phase.
