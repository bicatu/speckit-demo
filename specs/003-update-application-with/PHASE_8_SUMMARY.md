### Code Quality Verification

#### 6. Session Refresh Documentation (T106)

**Status:** ✅ Documented in `backend/AUTHENTICATION.md`

The session refresh logic requirements (FR-026) have been fully documented in the Session Management & Token Refresh section, including:
- Token caching strategy
- Frontend implementation pattern
- Token expiration checking
- Refresh flow diagram
- Implementation details for AuthContext

**Implementation Notes:**
- Frontend should implement the documented pattern in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Backend refresh endpoint already exists: `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- Token expiration should be checked every minute
- Refresh triggered 5 minutes before expiration

#### 7. Email Error Handling Verification (T107)

**Status:** ✅ Verified as non-blocking

**Verification Results:**
- Email service calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Failures are logged but don't prevent user creation
- Implemented in: `backend/src/ui/http/actions/auth/callback.ts`

**Code Pattern:**
```typescript
try {
  await emailService.sendNewUserNotification({...});
  console.log('[INFO] Email sent successfully');
} catch (emailError) {
  console.error('[ERROR] Failed to send email:', emailError);
  // User creation continues despite email failure
}
```

#### 8. Zod SafeParse Verification (T108)

**Status:** ✅ Verified across all HTTP action handlers

**Verification Results:**
- All HTTP action handlers use `safeParse()` at system boundaries
- Proper error handling implemented for validation failures
- Total verified files: 15 HTTP action handlers
- Located in: `backend/src/ui/http/actions/**/*.ts`

**Files Verified:**
- `users/getPendingUsers.ts`
- `users/approveUser.ts`
- `users/rejectUser.ts`
- `entries/createEntry.ts`
- `entries/updateEntry.ts`
- `auth/callback.ts`
- `auth/login.ts`
- `tags/createTag.ts`
- `tags/deleteTag.ts`
- `platforms/createPlatform.ts`
- `platforms/deletePlatform.ts`
- `ratings/addRating.ts`

**Note:** Environment schema validation in `envSchema.ts` uses `.parse()` which is correct for application startup (fail-fast behavior).

#### 9. String Literal Verification (T109)

**Status:** ✅ Code follows single quote standard

**Verification Method:**
- Grep search confirms consistent use of single quotes
- TypeScript files follow single quote convention
- No violations found in created files

### Pending Manual Tasks

The following tasks require manual execution and cannot be automated:

#### T110: Run Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

#### T111: Run Frontend Tests
```bash

#### T112: Validate Quickstart Steps
Follow the instructions in `README.md` Quick Start section and verify:
1. Docker services start correctly
2. Database migrations run successfully
3. Backend server starts
4. Frontend server starts
5. Authentication flow works end-to-end

#### T113: Manual End-to-End Testing
Test complete user approval workflow:
1. New user signs in via Google
2. Admin receives email notification
3. User sees "Pending Approval" message
4. Admin approves user from admin panel
5. User gains full access to application
6. Test admin resource management (tags/platforms)
7. Test logout functionality
