# Tasks: Multi-User Movie & Series Tracking Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-multi-user-movie/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml

**Tests**: Test tasks are included following TDD principles as specified in the Constitution. All tests must be written FIRST and must FAIL before implementation begins.

**TypeScript Code Standards**: All code MUST follow constitution standards: single quotes for strings, `crypto.randomUUID()` for UUIDs, early returns preferred, and Zod validation at UI/Infrastructure boundaries using `safeParse()` with proper error handling.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a web application with backend (DDD layers) and frontend (React SPA):
- **Backend**: `backend/src/domain/`, `backend/src/application/`, `backend/src/infrastructure/`, `backend/src/ui/`, `backend/tests/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/components/`, `frontend/src/pages/`, `frontend/src/services/`, `frontend/tests/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Additional Features (Phase 9)**: Depends on Phase 2 (can be done in parallel with user stories)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1) - Browse**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2) - Rate**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies, but benefits from US1 for viewing ratings
- **User Story 3 (P3) - Add Content**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies, integrates with US1 for display
- **User Story 4 (P3) - Filter**: Extends US1 - Can start after Foundational, requires last_login tracking
- **User Story 5 (P3) - Edit**: Extends US1/US3 - Can start after Foundational
- **User Story 6 (P4) - Admin**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent admin features

### Within Each User Story (TDD Pattern)

1. **Tests FIRST**: Write all tests for the story and ensure they FAIL (Red)
2. **Domain Layer**: Create entities, value objects, repository interfaces (Green)
3. **Application Layer**: Create commands/queries and handlers (Green)
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Implement repositories (Green)
5. **UI Layer**: Create HTTP actions and routes, frontend components (Green)
6. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green (Refactor)
7. **Story Complete**: All tests pass, story independently testable

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 (Setup)
- T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T009, T011, T012 can run in parallel

#### Phase 2 (Foundational)
- Backend: T016, T017, T018, T019, T023, T024 can run in parallel
- Frontend: T025, T026, T027, T028 can run in parallel
- Backend and Frontend foundational work can proceed in parallel

#### Within Each User Story
- **All tests can run in parallel** (T029-T043 for US1, etc.)
- **All domain entities can be created in parallel** (T044-T048 for US1, etc.)
- **All repository interfaces can be created in parallel** (T050-T053 for US1, etc.)
- **Frontend components can be built in parallel** (T073-T077 for US1, etc.)

#### Across User Stories (After Foundational Phase)
- Once Phase 2 completes, US1, US2, US3, US4, US5, and US6 can all be worked on by different team members in parallel
- Each story is independently testable and deployable

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Write all tests together (they will fail - that's expected in TDD):
T029: Unit test for Entry entity
T030: Unit test for GenreTag entity
T031: Unit test for EntryFilters value object
T032: Unit test for GetEntriesQueryHandler
T033: Unit test for GetEntryDetailsQueryHandler
T034: Integration test for PostgresEntryRepository
T035: Integration test for GetEntriesQuery flow
T036: Contract test for GET /entries
T037: Contract test for GET /entries/:entryId
T038-T043: All frontend tests

# Create all domain entities in parallel:
T044: User entity
T045: Entry entity
T046: GenreTag entity
T047: StreamingPlatform entity
T048: Rating entity
T049: EntryFilters value object

# Create all repository interfaces in parallel:
T050: IUserRepository
T051: IEntryRepository
T052: IGenreTagRepository
T053: IRatingRepository

# Create all frontend components in parallel:
T073: EntryCard component
T074: EntryList component
T075: FilterBar component
T076: Pagination component
T077: EntryDetails component
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Browse and Discover)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Can users browse entries?
   - Does filtering by tags work?
   - Does pagination work correctly?
   - Can users view entry details with ratings?
5. Deploy/demo MVP

**MVP Value**: Users can immediately discover and browse community-rated content without needing to contribute first.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP! Users can browse)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Users can now rate)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Users can now add content)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Users can filter personal activity)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Users can edit content)
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Admins can manage platforms/tags)
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (critical path)
2. **Once Foundational is done**, split work:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Browse) - MVP priority
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Ratings)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Add Content)
3. After US1-3 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 4 (Filter)
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (Edit)
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (Admin)
4. All developers: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
5. Stories integrate cleanly due to DDD architecture and independent design

## Task Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 204
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 12 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 16 tasks (backend + frontend foundation)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - Browse)**: 55 tasks (includes comprehensive tests)
- **Phase 4 (US2 - Rate)**: 19 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Add Content)**: 26 tasks
- **Phase 6 (US4 - Filter)**: 7 tasks
- **Phase 7 (US5 - Edit)**: 14 tasks
- **Phase 8 (US6 - Admin)**: 34 tasks
- **Phase 9 (Account Deletion)**: 9 tasks
- **Phase 10 (Polish)**: 17 tasks

### Parallel Opportunities Identified

- **Setup Phase**: 8 tasks can run in parallel
- **Foundational Phase**: 8 tasks can run in parallel (within backend/frontend groups)
- **User Story 1**: 30+ tasks can run in parallel (tests, entities, components)
- **Across Stories**: After foundational phase, 6 user stories can be developed in parallel by different team members

### Independent Test Criteria

- **US1**: Browse entries, filter by tags, paginate, view details ‚Üí No dependencies on other features
- **US2**: Add/update ratings ‚Üí Requires US1 for viewing but rating logic is independent
- **US3**: Add new entries ‚Üí Requires US1 for display but creation logic is independent
- **US4**: Filter by "new to me" ‚Üí Extends US1 filtering
- **US5**: Edit entries ‚Üí Extends US1/US3 entry management
- **US6**: Admin management ‚Üí Completely independent admin features

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Minimum Viable Product**: Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (User Story 1)

**Why**: User Story 1 delivers immediate value - users can browse and discover community-rated content without needing to contribute first. This validates the core browsing and discovery UX before investing in content creation features.

**MVP Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Users can browse paginated list of entries
- [ ] Users can filter entries by genre tags
- [ ] Users can view detailed entry information with ratings
- [ ] Average ratings calculate correctly
- [ ] Pagination performs within 2 seconds per page
- [ ] Entry lists load within 3 seconds with 1000+ entries

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD Required**: Verify tests fail before implementing (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- **Constitution Compliance**: All code follows TypeScript standards (single quotes, crypto.randomUUID(), early returns, Zod validation)
- **DDD Principles**: Strict layering maintained (Domain ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Infrastructure ‚Üí UI)
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
