# Feature Specification: Multi-User Movie & Series Tracking Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-multi-user-movie`  
**Created**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "multi-user movie series tracking application"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-15

- Q: Which OAuth2 provider should be used for user authentication in production and local development? → A: WorkOS for production with a local (docker) option
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent edits to the same entry by multiple users? → A: Last-write-wins (simpler, most recent save overwrites previous changes)
- Q: Which database technology should be used for storing users, entries, ratings, platforms, and tags? → A: PostgreSQL (Relational, strong ACID guarantees, excellent Docker support, mature TypeScript ecosystem)
- Q: What happens to a user's entries and ratings when their account is deleted? → A: Anonymize user data (keep entries/ratings, replace user reference with "Deleted User")
- Q: Should ratings allow decimal values (e.g., 7.5 stars) or only whole numbers? → A: Whole numbers only (1-10 integers, simpler UI and user experience)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse and Discover Content (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to browse existing movies and series entries to discover new content to watch and see what others have rated highly.

**Why this priority**: This is the core discovery feature that delivers immediate value to users without requiring them to contribute content first. Users can benefit from the community's recommendations immediately.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the application and browsing the list of entries, filtering by tags, and viewing detailed information about individual movies/series.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** there are existing movie/series entries, **When** I visit the main page, **Then** I see a list of entries ordered by creation date (newest first)
2. **Given** I'm viewing the entry list, **When** I select a tag filter, **Then** I see only entries that contain that tag
3. **Given** I select a tag filter with no associated entries, **When** I view the results, **Then** I see an empty list (0 entries) with appropriate message
4. **Given** there are more than 10 entries, **When** I view the list, **Then** I see pagination with maximum 10 entries per page
5. **Given** I select a specific movie/series, **When** I view its details, **Then** I see title, tags, average rating, creator, and all individual user ratings

### User Story 2 - Add Personal Ratings (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to rate movies and series that others have added so I can share my opinions and contribute to the community ratings.

**Why this priority**: This enables community participation and builds the collaborative aspect of the platform. Users can contribute value without having to add new content.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by viewing an existing entry and adding/updating a personal rating, then verifying the rating appears in the entry details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm viewing a movie/series entry, **When** I add a rating (1-10 whole number stars), **Then** my rating is saved and appears in the ratings list
2. **Given** I have previously rated an entry, **When** I update my rating, **Then** the new rating replaces my previous rating
3. **Given** multiple users have rated an entry, **When** I view the entry details, **Then** I see the updated average rating

---

### User Story 3 - Add New Content (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to add new movies and series to the platform so I can track content I've watched and share discoveries with the community.

**Why this priority**: This enables content growth but requires more user engagement. The platform can still provide value with existing content while this feature allows expansion.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding a new movie/series entry with required information and verifying it appears in the main list and can be rated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to add a new entry, **When** I provide title and select up to 3 genre tags, **Then** the entry is created and appears in the main list
2. **Given** I'm adding a new entry, **When** I optionally specify a streaming platform and my personal rating, **Then** this information is saved with the entry
3. **Given** I try to add an entry with a duplicate title, **When** I submit the form, **Then** I receive an error message that the title already exists

---

### User Story 4 - Filter by Personal Activity (Priority: P3)

As a returning user, I want to see what's new since my last visit so I can quickly catch up on community activity.

**Why this priority**: This improves user engagement for returning users but is not essential for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in, noting the last login time, having other users add/update content, then returning and using the "new to me" filter.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I haven't logged in for some time, **When** I select "new to me" filter, **Then** I see only entries created or updated since my last login
2. **Given** no new activity since my last login, **When** I select "new to me" filter, **Then** I see an empty list with appropriate message

---

### User Story 5 - Edit Existing Content (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to update movie/series information to keep the database accurate and current.

**Why this priority**: Data quality is important but not critical for initial value delivery. Users can still benefit from the platform even with occasional inaccuracies.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by editing an existing entry's title or tags and verifying the changes are reflected in all views.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want to update an entry, **When** I edit the title to a unique value, **Then** the updated title is saved and displayed
2. **Given** I want to modify tags, **When** I add or remove tags (keeping maximum of 3), **Then** the tag changes are saved
3. **Given** I try to change a title to one that already exists, **When** I submit the form, **Then** I receive an error message

---

### User Story 6 - Admin Platform Management (Priority: P4)

As an admin user, I want to manage streaming platforms and available tags to maintain data quality and consistency across the platform.

**Why this priority**: Administrative features are important for long-term maintenance but not required for initial user value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as admin and managing the streaming platforms and tags lists, verifying that in-use items cannot be deleted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm an admin user, **When** I add a new streaming platform, **Then** it becomes available for selection when adding/editing entries
2. **Given** I'm an admin user, **When** I try to delete a streaming platform that's in use, **Then** I receive an error message preventing deletion
3. **Given** I'm an admin user, **When** I add new tags to the available list, **Then** they become available for selection
4. **Given** I'm an admin user, **When** I try to delete a tag that's in use, **Then** I receive an error message preventing deletion

### Edge Cases

- Ratings must be whole numbers (1-10 integers); decimal values are rejected with validation error
- Concurrent edits to the same entry use last-write-wins strategy (most recent save overwrites previous changes without conflict detection)
- What happens when the last admin user is deleted or deactivated?
- How does pagination behave when entries are added/removed while browsing?
- When a user's account is deleted, their entries and ratings are preserved with user reference anonymized to "Deleted User"
- How does the system display results when a tag filter returns 0 entries?
