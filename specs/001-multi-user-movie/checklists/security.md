# Security Requirements Quality Checklist

**Purpose**: Validates completeness, clarity, and consistency of authentication, authorization, and API security requirements. This checklist tests whether security requirements are well-written, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works correctly.

**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Focus**: Authentication & Authorization, API Security Standards  
**Risk Priority**: Critical  
**Feature**: Multi-User Movie & Series Tracking Application

## Summary

**Total Items**: 77  
**Focus Areas**: Authentication & Authorization, OAuth2/WorkOS Integration, API Security Standards  
**Critical Risks Covered**: SQL injection, authentication bypass, unauthorized admin access, token validation, privilege escalation, information leakage, PII exposure  
**Depth Level**: Critical security requirements quality validation  
**Audience**: Requirements author, security reviewer, API architect

**Key Findings**:

- Many critical security requirements are missing from the specification (marked with `[Gap]`)
- OAuth2 implementation details need clarification (token handling, validation, refresh)
- Authorization rules need explicit definition for all operations
- Ambiguity exists around "any user can edit entries" (FR-010) vs. typical ownership patterns
- API security standards (input validation, rate limiting, error handling) are not documented
- Local development OAuth mock requirements are unspecified
- Audit logging and security monitoring requirements are absent

**Next Steps**: Address high-priority gaps (CHK030, CHK034, CHK042, CHK045, CHK057, CHK059, CHK061, CHK063) before implementation begins.
