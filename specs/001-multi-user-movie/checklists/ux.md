# UX Requirements Quality Checklist

**Purpose**: Validates completeness, clarity, and consistency of user experience requirements focusing on task flows, user journeys, and interaction patterns. This checklist tests whether UX requirements are well-written, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the UI works correctly.

**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Focus**: User Journey & Task Flow, Secondary Scenarios  
**Specificity**: General UX patterns and principles  
**Feature**: Multi-User Movie & Series Tracking Application

## Summary

**Total Items**: 104  
**Completed**: 1  
**Incomplete**: 103  
**Focus Areas**: User Journey & Task Flow, Form Interactions, Entry Management Workflows  
**Scenario Priority**: Secondary scenarios (add/edit entry, pagination, admin management)  
**Specificity Level**: General UX patterns and principles  
**Audience**: Requirements author, UX designer, product owner

**Key Findings**:

- Most user journey flow requirements are missing from the specification (marked with `[Gap]`)
- Task flow steps are not explicitly documented (entry creation, rating submission, editing)
- Feedback mechanisms (loading states, success messages, error handling) are unspecified
- Empty state requirements exist only for filtered results (FR-007a), not for other scenarios
- Form interaction patterns need detailed specification (validation timing, button states)
- Navigation patterns and information architecture are undocumented
- Accessibility requirements (keyboard nav, screen readers, focus management) are absent
- ✓ **Resolved**: Collaborative editing authorization clarified (CHK093) - User Story 5 now includes explicit authorization model and cross-user editing acceptance scenario
- Admin interface requirements lack detail despite dedicated user story

**Next Steps**: Address high-priority gaps in user journeys (CHK001-CHK010), form interactions (CHK040-CHK047), and feedback mechanisms (CHK025-CHK033) before wireframing or UI development begins.
