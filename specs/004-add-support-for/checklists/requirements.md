# Specification Quality Checklist: PKCE Support for OpenID Connect Authentication

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All validation checks passed**

### Detailed Review

**Content Quality**:
- ✅ Specification is written in terms of user flows and security outcomes, not implementation details
- ✅ Focus is on WHAT (PKCE security) and WHY (prevent authorization code interception), not HOW
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders (explains OAuth flow in plain terms)
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- ✅ All 12 functional requirements are testable with clear pass/fail criteria
- ✅ 6 success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (percentages, time limits)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific libraries or code patterns)
- ✅ 4 detailed acceptance scenarios per user story define expected behavior
- ✅ 5 edge cases identified covering storage failures, unsupported servers, and security scenarios
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded to PKCE implementation without expanding to other auth features
- ✅ Assumptions section documents dependencies on provider support and browser capabilities

**Feature Readiness**:
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories cover frontend flow (P1), backend support (P2), and storage (P3)
- ✅ Success criteria SC-001 through SC-006 provide clear validation metrics
- ✅ No leakage of implementation details (no mention of specific libraries, storage APIs, or code structure)

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command. No updates required.
