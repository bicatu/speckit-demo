# Feature Specification: Login/Logout Authentication UI

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-login-logout`  
**Created**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add login, logout support to the application (frontend and backend) using WorkOS for production and keycloack for development"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19

- Q: When a user's access token expires while they're actively using the application (e.g., filling out a form, browsing entries), what should happen? → A: Allow current action to complete, then redirect to login with message; preserve intended action to retry after re-auth
- Q: When the authentication provider (Keycloak/WorkOS) is unavailable or times out during login or token validation, what timeout threshold and retry behavior should the system implement? → A: 5 second timeout with 1 automatic retry, then fail with error and manual retry option
- Q: When a user logs in on multiple devices or browsers simultaneously, how should their sessions be managed? → A: Allow concurrent sessions on multiple devices (each device maintains independent session)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - User Login (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to log into the application so I can access personalized features and my saved data.

**Why this priority**: This is the core authentication flow that enables all user-specific functionality. Without login, users cannot access ratings, create entries, or use any personalized features.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking a login button, being redirected to the authentication provider (Keycloak in dev, WorkOS in production), completing authentication, and being redirected back to the application with an authenticated session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an unauthenticated user on the application, **When** I click the "Log In" button, **Then** I am redirected to the authentication provider login page
2. **Given** I am on the authentication provider login page, **When** I enter valid credentials and submit, **Then** I am redirected back to the application with an active authenticated session
3. **Given** I have successfully logged in, **When** I view the application header, **Then** I see my username/email displayed and a "Log Out" button instead of "Log In"
4. **Given** I am authenticated, **When** I make API requests to protected endpoints, **Then** my session token is automatically included and validated
5. **Given** I previously logged in and my session is still valid, **When** I return to the application, **Then** I remain logged in without re-authenticating

---

### User Story 2 - User Logout (Priority: P1)

As a logged-in user, I want to log out of the application so I can end my session securely, especially on shared devices.

**Why this priority**: Essential security feature that allows users to explicitly terminate their session. Critical for shared/public computers and security-conscious users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in, then clicking the logout button, and verifying the session is terminated both in the frontend and backend.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I click the "Log Out" button, **Then** my session is terminated and I am redirected to the unauthenticated home page
2. **Given** I have just logged out, **When** I attempt to access protected features, **Then** I am prompted to log in again
3. **Given** I log out, **When** I check the application state, **Then** my cached authentication tokens are cleared from browser storage
4. **Given** I log out with the authentication provider logout URL available, **When** the logout completes, **Then** I am also logged out from the identity provider session (Single Logout)

---

### User Story 3 - Session Management (Priority: P2)

As the application, I want to manage user sessions efficiently so that performance is optimized while maintaining security.

**Why this priority**: Improves performance and user experience by reducing authentication overhead, but login/logout functionality is more critical to establish first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by monitoring API calls to the authentication provider, verifying that validated tokens are cached in-memory, and confirming tokens are not re-validated unnecessarily.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user's access token has been validated, **When** subsequent API requests are made within the token's TTL, **Then** the cached validation result is used without calling the authentication provider
2. **Given** a token is cached, **When** the token's expiration time is reached, **Then** the cached entry is automatically invalidated
3. **Given** a user logs out, **When** their session is terminated, **Then** all cached tokens associated with that session are immediately invalidated
4. **Given** multiple concurrent requests from the same user, **When** token validation is needed, **Then** only one validation call to the authentication provider is made (deduplication)

---

### User Story 4 - Authentication Error Handling (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want clear feedback when authentication fails so I can understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience during authentication failures, but core login/logout flows take precedence.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating various authentication failures (invalid credentials, expired tokens, provider unavailable) and verifying appropriate error messages are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I attempt to log in with invalid credentials, **When** authentication fails, **Then** I see a clear error message explaining the authentication failure
2. **Given** my session token has expired, **When** I make an API request, **Then** I am redirected to log in again with a message indicating session expiration
3. **Given** the authentication provider is unavailable, **When** I attempt to log in, **Then** I see an error message indicating a temporary service issue
4. **Given** authentication fails during the OAuth callback, **When** I am redirected back to the application, **Then** I see an error message and am given the option to retry

---

### User Story 5 - Environment-Specific Authentication (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want the application to use Keycloak for local/staging environments and WorkOS for production so that development is simplified while production uses the enterprise authentication service.

**Why this priority**: Important for development workflow and deployment flexibility, but users don't directly interact with this distinction.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deploying to different environments with different configuration and verifying the correct authentication provider is used in each environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is running in development mode, **When** I initiate login, **Then** I am redirected to the Keycloak authentication page
2. **Given** the application is running in production mode, **When** I initiate login, **Then** I am redirected to the WorkOS authentication page
3. **Given** environment configuration is set, **When** the backend validates tokens, **Then** it uses the appropriate provider's token verification endpoint
4. **Given** I switch environments, **When** I log in, **Then** existing sessions from other environments do not interfere

### Edge Cases

- Token expires mid-action: Allow current action to complete, redirect to login with message, preserve action for retry after re-auth (see FR-021, FR-022)
- Authentication provider timeout: 5 second timeout with 1 automatic retry, then fail with error and manual retry option (see FR-023, FR-024, FR-025)
- Multi-device login: Allow concurrent independent sessions on multiple devices/browsers (see FR-026)
- What happens if a user logs in on multiple devices/browsers simultaneously?
- How are users redirected back to their intended page after authentication (deep linking)?
- What happens when OAuth state parameter validation fails (CSRF protection)?
- How does the system handle malformed or tampered tokens?
- What happens when token caching memory limits are reached?
- How are authentication errors from the provider's API distinguished and handled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Log In" button/link in the application header when user is unauthenticated
- **FR-002**: System MUST redirect users to the authentication provider's login page using OpenID Connect Authorization Code flow with PKCE
- **FR-003**: System MUST support Keycloak as the authentication provider for development and staging environments
- **FR-004**: System MUST support WorkOS as the authentication provider for production environments
- **FR-005**: System MUST determine which authentication provider to use based on environment configuration (environment variable)
- **FR-006**: Frontend MUST handle OpenID Connect callback and exchange authorization code for access tokens via backend API
- **FR-007**: Backend MUST validate access tokens on every authenticated API request
- **FR-008**: Backend MUST cache validated JWT tokens in-memory to minimize round-trips to authentication provider
- **FR-009**: Backend MUST respect token TTL (time-to-live) and automatically invalidate cached tokens upon expiration
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a "Log Out" button in the application header when user is authenticated
- **FR-011**: Logout MUST clear the user's session both in the application frontend and backend
- **FR-012**: Logout MUST invalidate cached tokens immediately upon logout
- **FR-013**: Logout MUST redirect user to the authentication provider's logout endpoint when available (Single Logout support)
- **FR-014**: System MUST display user identity (username or email) in the application header when authenticated
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle authentication errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-016**: System MUST redirect users back to their originally requested page after successful authentication
- **FR-017**: System MUST protect against CSRF attacks using OpenID Connect state parameter validation
- **FR-018**: Frontend MUST store minimal session information after authentication (exactly 4 fields: user ID, email, display name, admin status - no tokens in localStorage/sessionStorage per security requirements)
- **FR-019**: Frontend MUST clear all stored authentication data on logout
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle concurrent token validation requests efficiently (deduplication)
- **FR-021**: When an access token expires during an active user session, system MUST allow the current action to complete, then redirect to login with a session expiration message
- **FR-022**: System MUST preserve the user's intended action (URL, form data context) when redirecting due to token expiry, enabling retry after re-authentication
- **FR-023**: Authentication provider API calls MUST implement a 5 second timeout
- **FR-024**: When an authentication provider call times out, system MUST automatically retry once before failing
- **FR-025**: After timeout and retry failure, system MUST display error message with manual retry option
- **FR-026**: System MUST allow concurrent sessions on multiple devices/browsers, with each device maintaining an independent session

### Key Entities

- **Authentication Session**: Represents an active user session with access token, refresh token (optional), expiration time, and user identity information
- **Token Cache Entry**: In-memory cache entry containing validated token data, user information, expiration timestamp, and validation timestamp
- **User Profile**: User identity information extracted from authenticated token including user ID (OAuth subject), email, display name, and admin status

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can complete the login flow (click login → authenticate → return to app) in under 30 seconds with a working authentication provider
- **SC-002**: Users can logout and terminate their session in under 3 seconds
- **SC-003**: Token validation for cached tokens completes in under 10ms (no external API call)
- **SC-004**: Token validation for uncached tokens completes in under 500ms (including authentication provider API call)
- **SC-005**: System maintains authentication state correctly across browser refresh without requiring re-login (within token TTL)
- **SC-006**: Authentication errors are displayed to users with clear, actionable messages within 2 seconds of occurrence (actionable = includes retry button or link, explains root cause in plain language, suggests specific next step like "check credentials" or "try again later")
- **SC-007**: System handles 1000 concurrent authenticated users without token caching performance degradation
- **SC-008**: 95% of users successfully complete login on first attempt without errors (assuming valid credentials)
- **SC-009**: Zero authentication tokens are leaked or exposed in browser console, URLs, or logs
- **SC-010**: Session termination on logout is immediate with 100% cache invalidation success rate
