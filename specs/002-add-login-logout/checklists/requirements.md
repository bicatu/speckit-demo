# Specification Quality Checklist: Login/Logout Authentication UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 19, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅
- **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on OAuth2/OpenID Connect standards without mentioning specific libraries, frameworks, or code structure
- **User value focused**: All user stories describe benefits from user perspective (access personalized features, secure session termination, clear feedback)
- **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language understandable by business stakeholders
- **All sections completed**: User scenarios, requirements, success criteria, assumptions, dependencies, and scope boundaries all present

### Requirement Completeness ✅
- **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are fully specified based on existing backend infrastructure (IAuthProvider abstraction) and standard OAuth2/OIDC flows
- **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified through testing (e.g., FR-001: verify login button appears, FR-008: measure cache performance)
- **Measurable success criteria**: All SC have specific metrics (SC-001: 30 seconds, SC-003: under 10ms, SC-008: 95% success rate)
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes (login completion time, session termination) without implementation details
- **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has 4-5 Given/When/Then scenarios covering core flows
- **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases covering token expiration, provider downtime, multi-device login, deep linking, CSRF, malformed tokens, memory limits
- **Clear scope boundaries**: In-scope (12 items) and out-of-scope (11 items) clearly defined
- **Dependencies identified**: 8 specific dependencies listed, 11 assumptions documented

### Feature Readiness ✅
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each user story has 4-5 acceptance scenarios defining expected behavior
- **Primary flows covered**: Login (P1), logout (P1), session management (P2), error handling (P2), environment switching (P3)
- **Measurable outcomes**: 10 success criteria covering performance, reliability, security, and user experience
- **No implementation leaks**: Specification avoids mentioning React, Koa, TypeScript, or specific libraries (only mentions standards like OAuth2, PKCE, JWT)

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command.

**Strengths**:
- Leverages existing backend authentication abstraction
- Clear prioritization (P1: core login/logout, P2: optimization/UX, P3: developer workflow)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Well-defined scope boundaries preventing scope creep

**Ready for next phase**: ✅ Proceed to `/speckit.plan`
